1. each of the pronouns in English (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, and them) comprising a set that shows contrasts of person, gender, number, and case  • 人称代词

【用法】1. The correct use of personal pronouns is one of the most debated areas of English usage. I, we, they, he, and she are subjective personal pronouns, which means they are used as the subject of the sentence, often coming before the verbshe lives in Paris; we are leavingMe, us, them, him, and her, on the other hand, are objective personal pronouns, which means that they are used as the object of a verb or prepositionJohn hates me; his father left him; I did it for herThis explains why it is not correct to say John and me went to the shopsthe personal pronoun is in subject position, so it must be I not me. Using the pronoun alone makes the incorrect use obviousme went to the shops is clearly not acceptable. This analysis also explains why it is not correct to say he came with you and Ithe personal pronoun is governed by a preposition (with) and is therefore objective, so it must be me not I. Again, a simple test for correctness is to use the pronoun alonehe came with I is clearly not acceptable. [See also usage at between.] Where a personal pronoun is used alone without the context of a verb or a preposition, however, the traditional analysis starts to break down. Traditionalists sometimes argue, for example, that she's younger than me and I've not been here as long as her are incorrect and that the correct forms are she's younger than I and I've not been here as long as sheThis is based on the assumption that than and as are conjunctions and so the personal pronoun is still subjective even though there is no verb (in full form it would be she's younger than I amYet for most native speakers the supposed ‘correct’ form does not sound natural at all and is almost never used in speech. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that, in modern English, those personal pronouns listed above as being objective are used neutrally—i.e. they are used in all cases where the pronoun is not explicitly subjective. From this it follows that, despite the objections of prescriptive grammarians (whose arguments are based on Latin rather than English), it is standard accepted English to use any of the followingWho is it? It's me!; she's taller than him; I didn't do as well as her
