1. [Brit. historical] a law relating to the support of the poor. Originally the responsibility of the parish, the relief and employment of the poor passed over to the workhouses in 1834. In the early 20th century the Poor Law was replaced by schemes of social security  • [英，史] 《济贫法》（救助穷人一度是教区的责任；1834年，救济穷人、安排穷人就业的事情转由工场来承担；20世纪初，《济贫法》被社会保障计划所取代）
2. In the 16th century UK legislation placed the responsibility for the relief of the unemployed, infirm, and disabled on the parish, and stipulated that work should be organized for the able-bodied poor. By the late 18th century the wages of low-paid workers were supplemented with parish allowances; the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 introduced the harsh regime of workhouses and the even harsher houses of correction. The system proved repressive and unable to cope with demand, and in the early 20th century the Poor Law was dismantled and replaced by schemes of social security
