2. The origins of popular music may be traced back to the 18th century, when hymns, folk tunes, and songs from ballad operas were first published in sheet-music form. The 19th century saw the popularity in Britain of the music hall; in the US popular songs included those written by Stephen Foster. In the early 20th century the invention of sound recording assisted the spread of ragtime, early jazz, and the songs of Tin Pan Alley beyond the US, while radio and gramophone popularized country music, big-band jazz, and blues from the late 1940s, and then rock and roll from the mid 1950s. Amplification of singing and frequently of instrumentation was by then usual. In recent years technology has become increasingly sophisticated and popular music is now an important industry, yet its basis is still the short, concise song. In the past decade the ubiquity of rock and pop among white audiences has been challenged by various forms of black music, such as reggae, rap, and house music, and world music
