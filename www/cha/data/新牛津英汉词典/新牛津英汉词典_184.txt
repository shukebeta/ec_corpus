★☆☆   quantum mechanics◙ plural noun
1. [treated as sing.] [Physics] the branch of mechanics that deals with the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles, incorporating the concepts of quantization of energy, wave–particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the correspondence principle  • [物理] 量子力学
2. Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and others developed quantum theory into a theory of atomic structure that reflects the dual properties of the electron as a wave and a particle, replacing Bohr's orbits by more diffuse orbitals. The principles of relativity theory were incorporated into quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac in 1928. Since then, quantum mechanics has been highly successful in accounting for the observed properties of the atomic nucleus and subatomic particles, and of electromagnetic fields

2. In 1900 Max Planck accounted for certain puzzling characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation given off by hot bodies by postulating that energy did not form a continuous spectrum but was emitted only in fixed amounts or ‘quanta’ Einstein suggested that all electromagnetic radiation, including light, could be regarded as consisting of particles or quanta of energy (photons). In 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a model of the atom that incorporated quantum theory, by supposing that electrons circle around a central nucleus in orbits corresponding to particular amounts of energy. This was later developed into the theory of quantum mechanics
