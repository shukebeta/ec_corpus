★☆☆   science fiction◙ [缩略词：SF] , noun
1. [mass noun] fiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and major social or environmental changes, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets  • 科幻小说
2. Science fiction emerged in the late 19th century in the works of writers such as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, although there are earlier precedents, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818). Following the First World War there was an upsurge in science-fiction writing in Britain and the US. It was during this period that the very popular science-fiction ‘pulp’ magazines became established, such as those of the US writer and publisher Hugo Gernsback (1884–1967), who was responsible for popularizing the term ‘science fiction’. After the dystopian visions of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Isaac Asimov, the period after the Second World War produced writers such as Ray Bradbury and Kurt Vonnegut in the US; in Britain in the 1960s writers associated with the magazine New Worlds, such as J. G. Ballard, introduced apocalyptic themes and political radicalism. Films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977), together with television series such as Dr Who (from 1963) and Star Trek (from 1966), have helped to bring popular science fiction to a wider audience. In the 1980s a new genre emerged, called cyberpunk

【派生】♦ Scottishness noun

【用法】1. The terms Scottish, Scot, Scots, and Scotch are all variants of the same word. They have had different histories, however, and in modern English they have developed different uses and connotations. The normal everyday word used to mean ‘of or relating to Scotland or its people’ is Scottish, as in Scottish people; Scottish hills; Scottish Gaelic; or she's English, not ScottishThe normal, neutral word for ‘a person from Scotland’ is Scot, along with Scotsman, Scotswoman, and the plural form the Scots (or, less commonly, the Scottish). The word Scotch, meaning either ‘of or relating to Scotland’ or ‘a person/the people from Scotland’, was widely used in the past by Scottish writers such as Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott. In the 20th century it has become less common; it is disliked by many Scottish people (as being an ‘English’ invention) and is now regarded as old-fashioned in most contexts. It survives in certain fixed phrases, as for example Scotch brothScotch mistand Scotch whisky Scots is used, like Scottish, as an adjective meaning ‘of or relating to Scotland’. However, it tends to be used in a narrower sense to refer specifically to the form of English spoken and used in Scotland, as in a Scots accent or the Scots word for ‘night’
