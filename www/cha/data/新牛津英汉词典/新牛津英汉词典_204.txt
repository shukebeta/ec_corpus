【派生】♦ sensualism noun
♦ sensualist noun
♦ sensualize verb
1. (也作 -ise)
♦ sensually adverb

【语源】1. late Middle English (in the sense 'sensory'): from late Latin sensualis, from sensus (see sense )

【用法】1. The words sensual and sensuous are frequently used interchangeably to mean ‘gratifying the senses’, especially in a sexual sense. Strictly speaking, this goes against a traditional distinction, by which sensuous is a more neutral term, meaning ‘relating to the senses rather than the intellect’, as in swimming is a beautiful, sensuous experiencewhile sensual relates to gratification of the senses, especially sexually, as in a sensual massageIn fact the word sensuous is thought to have been invented by Milton (1641) in a deliberate attempt to avoid the sexual overtones of sensual. In practice, the connotations are such that it is difficult to use sensuous in this sense. While traditionalists struggle to maintain a distinction, the evidence from the British National Corpus and elsewhere suggests that the ‘neutral’ use of sensuous is rare in modern English. If a neutral use is intended it is advisable to use alternative wording

【用法】1. The traditional definition of an adverb is that it is a word that modifies the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb, as in, for examplehe shook his head sadlyHowever, another important function of some adverbs is to comment on a whole sentence, either expressing the speaker's attitude or classifying the discourse. For example, in sadly, he is rather overbearingsadly does not mean that he is overbearing in a sad manner: it expresses the speaker's attitude to what is being stated. Traditionalists take the view that the use of sentence adverbs is inherently suspect and that they should always be paraphrased, e.g. using such wording as it is sad that he is rather overbearingA particular objection is raised to the sentence adverbs hopefully and thankfully, since they cannot even be paraphrased in the usual way (see usage at hopefully and thankfully ). However, there is overwhelming evidence that such usages are well established and widely accepted in everyday speech and writing
