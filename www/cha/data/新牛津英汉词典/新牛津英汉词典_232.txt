This has not always been the case. In Old English and Middle English some of these different functions of you were supplied by different words. Thus, thou was at one time the singular subjective casethou art a beastwhile thee was the singular objective casehe cares not for theeIn addition, the form thy (modern equivalent your) was the singular possessive determiner and thine (modern equivalent yours) the singular possessive pronoun, both corresponding to thee. The forms you and ye, on the other hand, were at one time reserved for plural uses. By the 19th century these forms were universal in standard English for both singular and plural, polite and familiar. In present day use, thou, thee, thy, and thine survive in some traditional dialects but otherwise are found only in archaic contextsthou²
