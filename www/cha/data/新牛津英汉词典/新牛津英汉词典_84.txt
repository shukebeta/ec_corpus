★☆☆   folk music◙ noun
1. [mass noun] music that originates in traditional popular culture or that is written in such a style. Folk music is typically of unknown authorship and is transmitted orally from generation to generation  • 民间音乐
2. Folk music, frequently transmitted orally from generation to generation, and whose authorship is often unknown, tends to have a relatively simple structure and melody, and to use portable instruments such as guitar, violin, harmonica, accordion, and bagpipes. Folk music is often monophonic, consisting of simple unaccompanied tunes, although vocal polyphony is common in southern and eastern Europe. While in some regions of Europe (e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, the Basque country, Macedonia, etc.) there has been an uninterrupted tradition of living folk music, concern began to be felt in the late 19th century in Britain and elsewhere that the folk tradition would be lost. Pioneering collectors and revivers of folk music include Cecil Sharp and Percy Grainger in Britain, Dvořák in Bohemia and Moravia, and Bartók and Kodály in Transylvania. During the Depression years in the US, Woody Guthrie revived interest in the form with his political protest songs; he had a strong influence on later figures such as Bob Dylan, who performed traditional folk material and also wrote new songs in a folk style. In Britain in the 1960s and 1970s groups such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span explored and expanded the form; electronic and other less traditional instruments began to be used, giving rise to a style known as folk rock. Recently much attention has been given to folk music from other cultures
