 USAGE NOTE 
In British English, using quite suggests you are not very enthusiastic about something. In American English, quite is a stronger way of qualifying an adjective. In both British and American English, the way you say the word is important. In British English, if you say it was quite good and you put the emphasis on the quite, you mean it was good, but not very good. If you put the emphasis on good, you mean it was very good. In British English, when it is used with adjectives like impossible or unacceptable, it means completely, and you put the emphasis on it. In American English, the emphasis is always on the adjective that goes with quite . 在英国英语中，quite 表示对某事不是十分热衷。 在美国英语中，quite 修饰形容词是一种语气较强的方式。 不管在英国英语还是美国英语中，说这个词的方式是很重要的。 在英国英语中，如果你说 it was quite good，重读 quite，那么你的意思是好，但不是非常好。 如果重读 good，那么就是“非常好”的意思。 在英国英语中，当 quite 和 impossible 或 unacceptable 等形容词连用时，它的意思是“完全”，需要重读。 在美国英语中，都是重读和 quite 连用的形容词。
