 Excuse me and pardon me are polite expressions that you use when you do something that could be slightly embarrassing or rude, for example in the cases below. You usually use sorry to apologize after you have done something wrong. excuse me 和 pardon me 是客套话，在做有点尴尬或粗鲁的事情时使用，如用于下列情况。 做了错事后一般用 sorry 来道歉。 
⇨ note at 见 REGRET 用法说明
   Use excuse me when you want to interrupt someone, say something to a person you do not know, or get past someone.  当需要打断某人、跟不认识的人说话或者请某人让路时，可以用 excuse me:

   Use excuse me when you have to leave someone for a short time.  不得不暂时离开某人时用 excuse me:
Excuse me for a moment while I make a call.  对不起请等一下，我打个电话。
   Excuse me can also be used, especially in American English, when you have not heard or understood what someone has said.  excuse me 亦可用于没有听见或听懂某人说的话时，尤用于美国英语:
'You're late.' 'Excuse me?' 'I said you're late.' 'Oh, sorry.'  “你迟到了。”“你说什么？”“我说你迟到了。”“噢，对不起。”
   Speakers of British English usually use pardon .  说英国英语的人一般用 pardon:
