They tackled them to the best of their ability.他们竭尽全力给予解决。Usage Note :
Do not confuse ability with capability and capacity. You often use ability to say that someone can do something well. He had remarkable ability as a musician. ...the ability to bear hardship. A person's capability is the amount of work they can do and how well they can do it. ...a job that was beyond the capability of one man. ...the director's ideas of the capability of the actor. If someone has a particular capacity, a capacity for something, or a capacity to do something, they have the qualities required to do it. Capacity is a more formal word than ability. ...their capacity for hard work. ...his capacity to see the other person's point of view.
    不要混淆 ability, capability 和 capacity。ability 常用于表示某人将某件事做好的能力：He had remarkable ability as a musician（他拥有杰出的音乐才华），the ability to bear hardship（承受苦难的能力）。capability 指某人所能完成的工作量以及所能达到的工作质量：a job that was beyond the capability of one man（个人力所不及的工作），the director's ideas of the capability of the actor（导演对于这个演员演技的看法）。capacity指做成某件事所需的素质, 用法比 ability 更加正式，例如 their capacity for hard work（他们能吃苦耐劳），his capacity to see the other person's point of view（他领会他人观点的能力）。
