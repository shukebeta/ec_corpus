Baggage is an uncount noun. You can have a piece of baggage or some baggage but you cannot have 'a baggage' or 'some baggages'. Both British and American speakers can refer to everything that travellers carry as their bags. American speakers can also call an individual suitcase a bag. In British English, people normally use luggage when they are talking about everything that travellers carry. Baggage is a more technical word and is used for example when discussing airports or travel insurance. In American English, luggage refers to empty bags and suitcases and baggage refers to bags and suitcases with their contents.baggage是一个不可数名词。可以说a piece of baggage或some baggage, 但不能说a baggage或some baggages。英国英语和美国英语中都可以把旅行者携带的所有东西称作bags。美国英语中也可以把单个的手提箱称为a bag。英国英语中，人们通常称旅行者携带的所有东西为luggage。baggage是一个比较专业的用语，可用于有关机场或旅行保险等话题中。美国英语中，luggage指空的包和手提箱，而baggage则指包和手提箱以及内装之物。
