'I won't say over the air who it is.' — 'No, quite.'“我不会在电话里说出那个人是谁。”——“对，的确应该这样。”Usage Note :
You can use quite in front of a or an when it is followed by an adjective plus noun. For example, you can say 'It's quite an old car' as well as 'The car is quite old', and 'It was quite a warm day' as well as 'The day was quite warm'. Note that, in sentences like these, quite comes in front of the indefinite article. You cannot say, for example, 'It's a quite old car'. Quite can be used to modify adjectives and adverbs, and is slightly stronger than fairly but less strong than very. Quite may suggest that something has more of a quality than expected. Nobody here's ever heard of it but it is actually quite common. Take care not to confuse quite and quiet.quite 可以用于 a 或 an 后接形容词加名词的结构之前。例如，可以说 It's quite an old car (这是一辆很旧的车)，也可以说 The car is quite old (这辆车很旧了)；可以说 It was quite a warm day (那是相当暖和的一天)，也可以说 The day was quite warm (那天很暖和)。需要注意的是，在此类句子中，quite 置于不定冠词的前面，例如不可以说It's a quite old car。quite 可以修饰形容词和副词，其程度稍强于 fairly，但弱于 very。quite 可以表示某事物比预料中更加具备某特点，例如，Nobody here's ever heard of it but it is actually quite common (这里没有人听说过它，但是它实际上颇为常见)。注意不要混淆 quite 与 quiet。
