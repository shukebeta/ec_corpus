'Well, he did have a sort of family connection with it, didn't he.' — 'Oh yes. Rather.'“那么，他的确和它有些家族渊源，是不是？”——“噢，是的，的确如此。”Usage Note :
Rather, pretty, quite, and fairly can all be used to modify adjectives and adverbs, but are all less strong than very. Rather and pretty are the strongest of these words and are the closest to very. Pretty, in this sense, is informal. Therefore, if you said to someone, 'Your work is pretty good' or 'Your work is rather good', they would be  more likely to be pleased than if you said 'Your work is quite good' or 'Your work is fairly good'. However, rather is commonly used with words indicating negative qualities. I was feeling rather sad. It is the  only one of these words than can be used  with comparatives, and with too. Global warming could be rather worse than we think it will be... He was becoming rather too friendly with my ex-boyfriend. Quite is slightly stronger than fairly, and may suggest that something has more of a quality than expected. Nobody here's ever heard of it but it is actually quite common.
    rather, pretty, quite 和 fairly 都可以用于修饰形容词和副词，但是它们都没有very的程度强。rather 和 pretty 在这4个词中程度最强，意思和very最接近。表达这个意思时pretty是非正式说法。因此，如果对某人说Your work is pretty good（你干得非常好）或Your work is rather good（你干得相当好）要比说Your work is quite good（你干得很不错）或Your work is fairly good（你干得还不错）更令他高兴。但是，rather 往往和有消极意义的词连用，如：I was feeling rather sad（我觉得很难过）。在这些词中唯有rather可以和比较级或too连用。如：Global warming could be rather worse than we think it will be（全球变暖可能比我们想象的更加严重），He was becoming rather too friendly with my ex-boyfriend（他和我的前男友好得有些过了头）。quite比fairly的程度稍强一些，表示某物有些超乎人们的期望。如：Nobody here's ever heard of it but it is actually quite common（这里没有人听说过它，但是它实际上颇为常见）。

Can you reach your toes with your fingertips?你能用手指尖碰到你的脚趾吗？Usage Note :
You use both reach and arrive to talk about coming to a particular place. Reach is always followed by a noun or pronoun referring to a place, and you can use it to emphasize the effort required to get there To reach the capital might not be easy. You can use arrive to emphasize being in a place rather than travelling to it. When I arrived in England I was exhausted. Arrive at and reach can also be used to say that someone eventually makes a decision or finds the answer to something. It took hours to arrive at a decision... They were unable to reach a decision.到达某一地点可以用reach和arrive。reach 后面常接表示地点的名词或代词，强调到达某地需要费力气：To reach the capital might not be easy（要到首都可能并非易事）。arrive表示到达一个地方，而不是前往的过程：When I arrived in England I was exhausted（我到达英格兰时已经筋疲力尽了）。arrive at 和 reach 都可以表示“作出…决定”或“找到…答案”：It took hours to arrive at a decision（作出决定花了数小时），They were unable to reach a decision（他们没能作出决定）。
