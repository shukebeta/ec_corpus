Really, Mr Riss, I expected better of you.坦白讲，里斯先生，我没想到你会那样。Usage Note :
Note that really and actually are both used to emphasize statements. You use really in conversation to emphasize something that you are saying. I really think he's sick. Note that when really is used in a negative sentence, its position in relation to the verb affects the meaning. For instance, if you say 'I really don't like Richard', with really in front of the verb, you are emphasizing how much you dislike Richard. However, if you say 'I don't really like Richard', with really coming after the negative, you are still saying that you dislike Richard, but the feeling is not particularly strong. When you use really in front of an adjective or adverb, it has a similar meaning to very. This is really serious. Actually is used to emphasize what is true or genuine in a situation, often when this is surprising, or a contrast with what has just been said. All the characters in the novel actually existed... He actually began to cry. It can also be used to be precise or to correct someone. No one was actually drunk... We couldn't actually see the garden.
    注意，really 和 actually 在句中都表强调。really在对话中强调所陈述的事实。如，I really think he's sick（我真的以为他病了）。really用在否定句中时，放在动词前或后的位置不同，句意不同。如，I really don't like Richard（我真的不喜欢理查德）。在这个句子里really放在动词前，强调不喜欢理查德的程度。但是，如果说I don't really like Richard (我不那么喜欢理查德），在这个句子里really放在否定词之后，仍然表示不喜欢理查德，但是程度没有那么强了。当really用在句中形容词或副词前时，意思和very一样。如，This is really serious (这真的很严重）。actually用来强调某种情形下实际或真实的情况，经常是令人吃惊的，或与前面提到的形成对照。如，All the characters in the novel actually existed（小说里的所有人物都是现实存在的），He actually began to cry (他竟然哭了起来），actually也可用来确定或更正某人的话或行为。如，No one was actually drunk（没有人真的喝醉了），We couldn't actually see the garden（我们实际上并不能看到花园）。
