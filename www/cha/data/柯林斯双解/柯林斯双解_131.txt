Do not confuse remember and remind. If you remember something, you are able to bring it back into your mind. He remembers everything that happened... I could not remember her name. If you remember to do something, you do what you are meant to do without forgetting or needing to be told to do it. He remembered to turn the gas off... Remember to put all your tools away. If someone reminds you of someone or something, they make you think about that person or thing. You cannot use 'remember' in this way. He reminds me of Maurice Fitzgerald... The pink dress reminds me of when I was a chauffeur in New York. You can use remember with the 'to' infinitive or the '-ing' form of the verb, but note that they have different meanings. If you remember to do something, you do it when you intend to. He remembered to buy his wife chocolates. If you remember doing something, you are thinking back to the past. I remember reading the newspaper aloud to my father at five.
    不要混淆 remember和remind。remember 表示能够记起某事，如，He remembers everything that happened (他记得发生的每一件事)，I could not remember her name (我记不起她的名字)。remember 后接不定式，表示记住要做某事，如，He remembered to turn the gas off (他记得要关掉煤气)，Remember to put all your tools away (记得把你的工具全部收起来)。remind 表示使某人想起某人或某事，而 remember 无此用法。如，He reminds me of Maurice Fitzgerald (他让我想起莫里斯·菲茨杰拉德)，The pink dress reminds me of when I was a chauffeur in New York (这件粉色衣服让我想起自己在纽约当司机的日子)。注意：remember 后面可接动词不定式或-ing形式，但意思不同。接不定式时意为记得要去做某事，如，He remembered to buy his wife chocolates. (他记得要给妻子买巧克力)。而接-ing形式意为记得曾经做过某事，如，I remember reading the newspaper aloud to my father at five (我记得在5岁的时候大声给父亲读报纸)。
