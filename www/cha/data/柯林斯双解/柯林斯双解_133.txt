7. See also: riding;   Usage Note :
When you want to say that someone is controlling a horse, bicycle, or motorbike, you can use ride as a transitive verb, with the object coming immediately after it. Whether you ride a motorbike, scooter or moped, get yourself properly trained. However, if you want to say that someone is a passenger in a vehicle, ride must be followed by a preposition. I was riding on the back of a friend's bicycle... We are still letting our children ride in the front seat of our cars. If ride is used without an object, a preposition, or any other phrase that specifies the context, it usually refers to the activity of riding a horse. 'Do you ride?' — 'No, I've never been on a horse.' 
    表示骑马、自行车或摩托车时，ride可以用作及物动词，宾语紧接其后：Whether you ride a motorbike, scooter or moped, get yourself properly trained（不管是骑摩托车、小轮摩托车还是机动自行车，都应接受适当的培训)。然而，表示乘交通工具时，ride必须和介词连用：I was riding on the back of a friend's bicycle (我当时坐在一个朋友的自行车后座上)，We are still letting our children ride in the front seat of our cars (我们仍然让孩子们坐在汽车的前座上)。如果ride后未接宾语、介词或其他明确语境的词组，通常表示骑马：‘Do you ride?’ — ‘No, I've never been on a horse’ (“你会骑马吗？”——“不会，我从来没有骑过”)。
