When you are talking about something being generally present or available, you can use around or about, but not round, as adverbs. There is a lot of talent around at the moment... There are not that many jobs about.
    round，about和around用作介词和副词时有多种用法，常用于构成短语动词。在大多数情况下，这3个词没有意义上的区别。在美国英语中around比round常用得多。about，around和round均可用于表示没有特定方向的随意运动：It's so romantic up there, flying around in a small plane (乘着小飞机四处翱翔，多么浪漫啊)，I spent a couple of hours driving round Richmond (我开车在里士满四处转了几个小时)，Police constables walk about with guns on their hips. (警察们胯上别着枪巡逻)。around，about 用作副词可以表示事物通常就在眼前或近在手边，此时不用round，There is a lot of talent around at the moment (目前有很多现成的人才)，There are not that many jobs about (现在并没有那么多的工作机会)。
