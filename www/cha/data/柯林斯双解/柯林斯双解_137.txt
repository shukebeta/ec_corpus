Professional people and office workers receive a salary, which is paid monthly. However, when talking about someone's salary, you usually give the annual figure. I'm paid a salary of £5,000 a year. Pay is a general noun which you can use to refer to the money you get from your employer for doing your job. Manual workers are paid wages, or a wage. The plural is more common than the singular, especially when you are talking about the actual cash that someone receives. Every week he handed all his wages in cash to his wife. Wages are usually paid, and quoted, as an hourly or a weekly sum. ...a starting wage of five dollars an hour. Your income consists of all the money you receive from all sources, including your pay.salary 指专业人员和办公室工作人员按月领取的薪水。然而，谈论某人的 salary 时，通常会给出年薪的数额：I'm paid a salary of £5, 000 a year (我的年薪为 5, 000 英镑)。pay 的意思较为笼统，指从雇主那里得到的工资。体力劳动者领取的工资用 wages 或 a wage，其复数形式比单数形式更为常用，尤其在谈论某人实际领到的现金时：Every week he handed all his wages in cash to his wife (每个星期，他都把挣到的钱全部交给妻子)。wages 通常按小时或星期支付计算：a starting wage of five dollars an hour (每小时 5 美元的起薪)。income 指所有渠道的收入总和，包括工资。
