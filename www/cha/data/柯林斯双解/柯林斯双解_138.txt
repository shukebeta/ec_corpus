Say, Leo, how would you like to have dinner one night, just you and me?哎，利奥，找个晚上一起吃顿饭如何，就你和我？Usage Note :
Note that, with the verb say, if you want to mention the person who is being addressed, you should use the preposition to. 'What did she say you?' is wrong. 'What did she say to you?' is correct. The verb tell, however, is usually followed by a direct object indicating the person who is being addressed. He told Alison he was suffering from leukaemia... What did she tell you? 'What did she tell to you?' is wrong. Say is the most general verb for reporting the words that someone speaks. Tell is used to report information that is given to someone. The manufacturer told me that the product did not contain corn. Tell can also be used with a 'to' infinitive to report an order or instruction. My mother told me to shut up and eat my dinner. 
    注意，如果要在动词 say 后提及说话的对象，应用介词 to。What did she say you 是错误说法，What did she say to you 是正确的。但是，动词 tell 后通常直接跟表示说话对象的直接宾语。例如：He told Alison he was suffering from leukaemia (他告诉艾利森他得了白血病)，What did she tell you (她告诉你什么了)。What did she tell to you 是错误说法。say 是引述某人所说话的最常用动词。tell 用于传达提供给某人的信息：The manufacturer told me that the product did not contain corn (厂家告诉我该产品不含谷物)。tell 也可和带 to 的动词不定式连用表示引述命令或指示：My mother told me to shut up and eat my dinner (妈妈让我别说话好好吃饭)。
