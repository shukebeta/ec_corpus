If you believe in yourself you can succeed.只要自信，就能成功。Usage Note :
Note that when you are using the verb believe with that-clause in order to state a negative opinion or belief, you normally make believe negative, rather than the verb. For instance, it is more usual to say 'He didn't believe she could do it...' than 'He believed she couldn't do it'. The same applies to other verbs with a similar meaning, such as consider, suppose, and think. I don't consider that you kept your promise... I don't suppose he ever saw it... I don't think he saw me. 
    注意，当 believe 和 that 从句连用陈述否定的观点或看法时，通常对 believe 而不是从句中的动词加以否定。例如，通常说 He didn't believe she could do it（他认为她做不到），而很少说 He believed she couldn't do it。同样的句型结构也适用于 consider, suppose 和 think 等意思相近的动词：I don't consider that you kept your promise（我认为你没有遵守诺言），I don't suppose he ever saw it（我想他从没见过它），I don't think he saw me（我认为他没有看到我）。

Big, large, and great are all used to talk about size. In general, large is more formal than big, and great is more formal than large. Big and large are normally used to describe objects, but you can also use big to suggest that something is important or impressive. ...his influence over the big advertisers. You normally use great to emphasize the importance of someone or something. ...the great English architect, Inigo Jones. However, you can also use great to suggest that something is impressive because of its size. The great bird of prey was a dark smudge against the sun. You can use large or great, but not big, to describe amounts. ...a large amount of blood on the floor. ...the coming of tourists in great numbers. Both big and great can be used to emphasize the intensity of something, although great is more formal. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you... Most of them act like big fools. Remember that great has several other meanings, when it does not refer to size, but to something that is remarkable, very good, or enjoyable.big, large 和 great 都可以用来表示大小。总的来说，large 比 big 更为正式，great 又比 large 更正式。big 和 large 一般用来形容物体，但是 big 也可以表示某物重要或令人印象深刻：his influence over the big advertisers（他对大广告客户的影响力）。great 通常用来强调某人或某物的重要性：the great English architect, Inigo Jones（英国伟大的建筑师伊尼戈·琼斯）。但是 great 也可以用来表示某物因为巨大而令人印象深刻：The great bird of prey was a dark smudge against the sun （逆着太阳望去，那只巨大的猛禽呈一团黑影）。large 和 great 可以用来形容数量，而 big 则不可以：a large amount of blood on the floor（地板上的一大摊血），the coming of tourists in great numbers（大量涌来的游客）。big 和 great 都可以用来强调强烈程度，但 great 更加正式：It gives me great pleasure to welcome you（很荣幸能迎接您的到来），Most of them act like big fools（他们中多数人都表现得跟大傻瓜似的）。注意 great 还有其他意义，不仅用来描述大小，还可以用来表示某物不同寻常、出色或令人愉快。
