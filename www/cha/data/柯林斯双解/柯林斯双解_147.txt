9. See also: smalls;   the small hours→see: hour; small wonder→see: wonder; Usage Note :
You can use the adjective small rather than little to draw attention to the fact that something is small. For instance, you cannot say 'The town is little' or 'I have a very little car', but you can say 'The town is small' or 'I have a very small car'. Little is a less precise word than small, and may be used to suggest the speaker's feelings or attitude towards the person or thing being described. For that reason, little is often used after another adjective. What a nice little house you've got here!... Shut up, you horrible little boy! 
    表示物体小的时候用 small，而不用 little，例如，不能说 The town is little 或者 I have a very little car，但是可以说 The town is small (这个城镇很小)，I have a very small car (我有一辆很小的车)。little 的意义不及 small 精确，可以用来表示说话人对所说的人或物的感情或态度。因此 little 常用于其他形容词之后，例如：What a nice little house you've got here (你这房子多么漂亮小巧呀)，Shut up, you horrible little boy (闭嘴！你这个可恶的小家伙)。
