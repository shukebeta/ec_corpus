14. See also: insofar as;   Usage Note :
So, very, and too can all be used to intensify the meaning of an adjective, an adverb, or a word like much or many. However, they are not used in the same way. Very is the simplest intensifier. It has no other meaning beyond that. So can suggest an  emotional reaction on the part of the speaker, such as pleasure, surprise, or disappointment. John makes me so angry!... Oh thank you so much! So can also refer forward to a result clause introduced by that. The procession was forced to move so slowly that he arrived three hours late. Too suggests an excessive or undesirable amount, often so much that a particular result does not or cannot happen. She does wear too much make-up at times... He was too late to save her. 
    so，very 和 too 都可以用来强调形容词、副词或 much，many 等词的意思，但用法有所不同。very 是最简单的强调词，除强调以外没有其他含义。so 可以表达说话人的情感，如喜悦、惊讶或失望等，例如：John makes me so angry (约翰真是让我生气)，Oh thank you so much (实在是太谢谢您啦)。so 还可以和 that 引导的结果状语从句相呼应，例如：The procession was forced to move so slowly that he arrived three hours late (由于行进队伍被迫缓慢进行，结果他迟到了 3 个小时)。too 表示数量过多或不尽如人意，常常导致没有或无法达到某一结果，例如：She does wear too much make-up at times (有时她化的妆确实太浓了)，He was too late to save her (他来得太晚了，没能救得了她)。
