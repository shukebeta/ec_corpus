Do not confuse spend and pass. If you spend a period of time doing something or spend time in a place, you do that thing or stay in that place for all of the time you are talking about. I spent three days cleaning our flat. ...a hotel where we could spend the night. If you do something while you are waiting for something else, you can say you do it to 'pass the time'. He had brought along a book to pass the time. You can say that time has passed in order to show that a period of time has finished. The first few days passed... The timne seems to have passed so quickly. 
    不要混淆 spend 和 pass。spend 表示花一段时间做某事或呆在某地，如：I spent three days cleaning our flat (我花了 3 天时间打扫我们的公寓)，a hotel where we could spend the night (可供我们过夜的旅馆)。如果在等待的过程中做某事消磨时间，可以说 pass the time，如：He had brought along a book to pass the time (他带了一本书来打发时间)。要表示一段时间过去了，可以用 pass，如：The first few days passed (头几天过去了)，The time seems to have passed so quickly (时间似乎过得很快)。
