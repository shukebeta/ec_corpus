Note that suggest cannot usually be followed directly by a noun or pronoun referring to a person. You generally have to put the preposition to in front of it. You do not 'suggest someone something', you 'suggest something to someone'. John Caskey first suggested this idea to me. Nor do you 'suggest someone to do something' unless suggest means recommend. You 'suggest that someone does something'. Beatrice suggested that he spend the summer at their place. Do not confuse suggest and advise. If you suggest something, you mention it as an idea or plan for someone to think about. If you advise someone to do something, you tell them what you think they should do. I advised him to leave as soon as possible.注意 suggest 后通常不能直接跟指人的名词或代词，一般要在这类名词或代词之前加介词 to。不能说 suggest someone something，而说 suggest something to someone，例如：John Caskey first suggested this idea to me (约翰·卡斯基首先向我提出了这一想法)。一般也不说suggest someone to do something，除非 suggest 表示推荐;一般会说 suggest that someone does something，例如：Beatrice suggested that he spend the summer at their place (比阿特丽斯提议他在他们那里度夏)。不要混淆suggest 和 advise。suggest 表示提出供他人考虑的想法或计划。advise 表示建议某人做某事，例如：I advised him to leave as soon as possible (我建议他尽快离开)。
