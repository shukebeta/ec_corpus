'Come on', she told herself...“加油！”她在心里暗暗打气。
I told myself I would be satisfied with whatever I could get.我告诉自己，不管得到什么我都会心满意足的。Usage Note :
Note that the verb tell is usually followed by a direct object indicating the person who is being addressed. He told Alison he was suffering from leukaemia... What did she tell you? 'What did she tell to you?' is wrong. With the verb say, however, if you want to mention the person who is being addressed, you should use the preposition to. 'What did she say you?' is wrong. 'What did she say to you?' is correct. Tell is used to report information that is given to someone. The manufacturer told me that the product did not contain corn. Tell can also be used with a 'to' infinitive to report an order or instruction. My mother told me to shut up and eat my dinner. Say is the most general verb for reporting the words that someone speaks.注意，动词tell后面往往跟一个表示听话者的直接宾语：He told Alison he was suffering from leukaemia (他告诉艾莉森他患了白血病)，What did she tell you (她对你说了些什么)。句子 What did she tell to you 是错误的。不过，用动词 say 时，若要提及听话者，应该用介词 to，What did she say you 不对，What did she say to you 是对的。tell 用来转述信息：The manufacturer told me that the product did not contain corn (制造商告诉我该产品不含谷物)。tell 也可以和 to 连用，用来转述命令、指示：My mother told me to shut up and eat my dinner (我妈叫我别说话专心吃饭)。转述某人说的话时，动词 say 最为常用。

In Britain, two different scales are commonly used for measuring temperature. On the Celsius (formerly Centigrade) scale, water freezes at zero degrees and boils at 100 degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. Celsius is the scale which is officially used for talking about the weather. Fahrenheit is considered more old-fashioned, but is still widely used. In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is almost always used. If you want to emphasize how cold it is, you are more likely to use Celsius, as the numbers are lower. Conversely, if you want to emphasize how warm it is, you are more likely to use Fahrenheit. The first of the following examples shows a temperature in Celsius and the second shows a temperature in Fahrenheit. The temperature has been down to minus seven... With temperatures in the 70s, sun lovers have been flocking to resorts. 
    在英国，测量温度普遍采用两种不同的标准。根据摄氏温标（以前称 Centigrade），水 0 度结冰，100 度沸腾;根据华氏温标，水 32 度结冰，212 度沸腾。正式谈论天气时使用摄氏温标。华氏温标被认为较为过时，不过使用仍很广泛。在美国，几乎总是用华氏温标。要想强调天冷，更有可能用摄氏温标，因为摄氏温标表示出的温度更低。相反，如果强调暖和，更可能用华氏温标。以下例子第一个用了摄氏度数，第二个用了华氏度数：The temperature has been down to minus seven (温度已经降到零下7度)，With temperatures in the 70s, sun lovers have been flocking to resorts (温度达到七十多度，喜爱阳光的人纷纷涌向度假胜地)。
