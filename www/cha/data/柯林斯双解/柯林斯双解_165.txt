6.   too bad→see: bad; too clever by half→see: clever; none too→see: none; Usage Note :
Too can be used to intensify the meaning of an adjective, an adverb, or a word like much or many. Too, however, also suggests an excessive or undesirable amount, often so much that a particular result does not or cannot happen. She does wear too much make-up at times… He was too late to save her. Too is not generally used to modify an adjective inside a noun group. For instance, you cannot say 'the too heavy boxes' or 'too expensive jewellery'. There is one exception to this rule, which is when the noun group begins with a or an. Notice the word order in the following examples. …if the products have been stored at too high a temperature… He found it too good an opportunity to miss… It was too long a drive for one day.
    too 可用来强化形容词、副词或类似 much，many 等词的词义。但是 too 也表示数量过多，常会导致某一特定结果没有或不能发生。例如：She does wear too much make-up at times (她有时确实化妆过浓)，He was too late to save her (他来得太晚，没能救活她）。通常too不用在名词词组中修饰形容词。例如，不可说 the too heavy boxes 或 too expensive jewellery。但当名词词组以a或an开头时例外。注意下面例子中的词序：if the products have been stored at too high a temperature（如果产品被储存在过高的温度下），He found it too good an opportunity to miss（他发现那是极好的机会，不容错过），It was too long a drive for one day（一天之中要驱车走那么远路程太长了。）
