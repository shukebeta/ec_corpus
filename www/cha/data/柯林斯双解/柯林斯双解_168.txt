Try and is often used instead of try to in spoken English, but you should avoid it in writing. Just try and stop me! Notice also the difference between try to and try with the '-ing' form of the verb, which often suggests doing something. I'm going to try to open a jammed door… Try opening the windows to freshen the air.英语口语中常用try and代替try to，但在书面语中应避免这种用法。如，Just try and stop me (你拦我试试看)。注意try to与try加动词ing形式的区别，后者经常表示建议做某事。如，I'm going to try to open a jammed door (我要设法打开一扇卡住的门)，Try opening the windows to freshen the air (试着把窗子打开，透透气）。
