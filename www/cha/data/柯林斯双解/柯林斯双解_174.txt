Mr Campbell said such programmes were by their very nature harmful...坎贝尔先生说此类节目本质上就是有害的。History is taking place before your very eyes.历史就在你的眼前发生。Usage Note :
Very, so, and too can all be used to intensify the meaning of an adjective, an adverb, or a word like much or many. However, they are not used in the same way. Very is the simplest intensifier. It has no other meaning beyond that. So can suggest an emotional reaction on the part of the speaker, such as pleasure, surprise, or disappointment. John makes me so angry!... Oh thank you so much! So can also refer forward to a result clause introduced by that. The procession was forced to move so slowly that he arrived three hours late. Too suggests an excessive or undesirable amount, often so much that a particular result does not or cannot happen. She does wear too much make-up at times... He was too late to save her. 
    very，so和too都可用来加强形容词、副词或much，many之类词语的含义，但它们的用法不尽相同。very 是最简单的强调词，除了表示强调没有其他含义。so可以表达说话者的情感反应，如高兴、惊讶或失望：John makes me so angry（约翰真是气死我了), Oh thank you so much（哦，非常感谢）。亦可用so与以that引导的结果从句连用：The procession was forced to move so slowly that he arrived three hours late（由于行进队伍被迫缓慢前进，结果他迟到了3个小时）。too表示数量过多或不尽如人意，常常导致没有或无法达到某一结果：She does wear too much make-up at times（她有时确实把妆化得太浓了），He was too late to save her（他来得太迟了，没能救得了她）。
