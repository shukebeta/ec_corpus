When used as a noun, pay is a general word which you can use to refer to the money you get from your employer for doing your job. Manual workers are paid wages, or a wage. The plural is more common than the singular, especially when you are talking about the actual cash that someone receives. Every week he handed all his wages in cash to his wife. Wages are usually paid, and quoted, as an hourly or a weekly sum. ...a starting wage  of five dollars an hour. Professional people and office workers receive a salary, which is paid monthly. However, when talking about someone's salary, you usually give the annual figure. I'm paid a salary of £15,000 a year. Your income consists of all the money you receive from all sources, including your pay.pay 用作名词时，泛指从雇主处得到的工资或薪水。体力劳动者的工资通常用 wages 或 a wage表示，其中复数形式更为常见，尤其是表示实际拿到的现金时。例如，Every week he handed all his wages in cash to his wife (每周他都将自己领到的工资全部交给妻子)。wages 通常按小时或按周支付或计算：a starting wage of five dollars an hour (每小时5美元的起薪)。专业人士以及办公室职员的工资用 salary 表示，通常按月支付。但是在谈论某人的薪水时，通常用年薪来表示：I'm paid a salary of £ 15, 000 a year (我年薪为15, 000英镑)。 income 表示从各个来源获得的总收入，包括工资。

Note that want and wish have similar meanings, but are used differently. If you want something, you feel a need for it or a desire to have it. You can say that you want to do something, that you want someone to do something, or that you want something to happen. If you use wish with a 'to' infinitive, this has the same meaning as want but is more formal. I want to get out of here... She wished to consult him about her future. 
    want 和 wish 意思相近，但用法不同。want 表示感觉需要或希望拥有某物。可以说 want to do something (想要做某事)，want someone to do something (想要某人做某事) 或 want something to happen (想要某事发生)。wish 与带 to 的不定式连用，和 want 意思一样，但更加正式。例如：I want to get out of here (我想要离开这里)，She wished to consult him about her future (她希望和他商量自己未来的发展)。
