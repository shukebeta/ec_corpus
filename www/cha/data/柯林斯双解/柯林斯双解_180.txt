Pa, I wish you wouldn't shout...爸，我希望你不要嚷嚷了。The world is not always what we wish it to be.世界并不总是如我们所愿。Usage Note :
Note that wish and want have similar meanings, but are used differently. If you want something, you feel a need for it or a desire to have it. You can say that you want to do something, that you want someone to do something, or that you want something to happen. If you use wish with a 'to' infinitive, this has the same meaning as want but is more formal. I want to get out of here... She wished to consult him about her future. Wish is normally followed by a 'that'-clause, although the word 'that' is often omitted from the clause. If you wish that something was the case, you would like it to be the case, even though this is unlikely or impossible. I wish I lived near London... He wished he had phoned for a cab. Note the use of the tenses in the examples; when wish is in the present tense, the past tense is used in the clause, and when wish is in the past tense, the past perfect tense is used in the clause.注意wish 与 want 虽意思相近，但用法不同。want 表示感觉需要或希望拥有某物，可以说 want to do something, want someone to do something 或 want something to happen。如果 wish 与带 to 的不定式连用，则与 want 意思相同，但语气要更正式：I want to get out of here (我想离开这里), She wished to consult him about her future (她想就自己未来的发展向他咨询意见)。wish 一般后接 that 从句，但从句中的 that 经常省略，表示虽然明知不太可能或完全没有可能，依然希望某事是真的：I wish I lived near London (我真希望自己住在伦敦附近)，He wished he had phoned for a cab (他真希望自己已经打电话叫出租车了)。注意上述例子中时态的用法：wish 用现在时，则从句用过去时;wish 用过去时，则从句用过去完成时。
