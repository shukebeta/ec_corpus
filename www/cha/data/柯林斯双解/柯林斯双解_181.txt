Note that when someone is hurt accidentally, for example, in a car crash or when they are playing sport, you do not use the word wound. You use injure and injury instead.

Wound is normally restricted to soldiers who are injured in battle, or to deliberate acts of violence against a particular person. ...stab wounds.
