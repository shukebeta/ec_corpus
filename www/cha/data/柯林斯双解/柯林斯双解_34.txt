The same pattern applies to other verbs with a similar meaning, such as believe, suppose, and think.注意动词 consider 与 that 从句连用表示否定的观点时，通常是对 consider 进行否定，而不是对从句中的动词进行否定。例如，I don't consider that you kept your promise（我认为你没有信守诺言）的说法比 I consider that you didn't keep your promise 的说法更常用。这种否定形式也适用于其他几个意思相近的动词，如 believe, suppose 和 think。
