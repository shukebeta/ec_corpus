Do not confuse drop and fall. Although things can drop or fall by accident, note that fall is not followed by an object, so you cannot say that someone 'falls' something. However, you can say that they drop something, or that something drops. Leaves were falling to the ground... He dropped his cigar... Plate after plate dropped from his fingers. You say that a person drops when they jump straight down from something, for example, when someone jumps from a plane using a parachute. If someone falls it is usually because of an accident. He stumbled and fell. Drop and fall are also nouns. A drop is the height of something when you imagine falling off it. Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop. A fall is what happens when someone has an accident. I had been badly bruised by the fall.
    不要混淆 drop 和 fall。二者均可指东西无意中掉落, 但是fall 不可接宾语，所以不可说someone falls something，却可说they drop something或者somehting drops。如，Leaves were falling to the ground（树叶落到了地上），He dropped his cigar（他扔掉了雪茄），Plate after plate dropped from his fingers（盘子一个接一个地从他指间掉落）。drop 还可指人从某物上跳下, 例如从飞机上跳伞。fall 指人时, 通常指人意外摔倒。如，He stumbled and fell（他绊了一下, 摔倒了）。drop 和 fall 均可用作名词。drop 作名词可指某人想象中物体降落的高度：Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop（1, 600 英尺是非常高的垂直距离了）。fall 指意外的跌落：I had been badly bruised by the fall（我摔得鼻青脸肿）。
