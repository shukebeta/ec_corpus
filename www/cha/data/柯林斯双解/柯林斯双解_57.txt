Note that you can use fall down to talk about people and objects, but for things like prices you should use the verb fall by itself. Suddenly she just fell down beside me... Share prices fell sharply during the day. Do not confuse fall and drop. Although things  can drop or fall by accident, note that fall is not followed by an object, so you cannot say that someone 'falls' something. However, you can say that they drop something, or that something drops. Leaves were falling to the ground... He dropped his cigar... Plate after plate dropped from his fingers. You say that a person drops when they jump straight down from something, for example, when someone jumps from a plane using a parachute. If someone falls it is usually because of an accident. He stumbled and fell. Drop and fall are also nouns. A drop is the height of something when you imagine falling off it. Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop. A fall is what happens when someone has an accident. I had been badly bruised by the fall. 
    注意 fall down 既可用于人亦可用于物，但如谈到价格一类的事物就只能单独用动词 fall。如：Suddenly she just fell down beside me (她突然在我身旁倒下了)，Share prices fell sharply during the day (股票价格在白天暴跌)。不要将 fall 与 drop 混淆。fall 和 drop 均可表示意外掉落，但 fall 后不跟宾语，因此不能说 someone falls something, 但可以说 someone drops something 或 something drops，如: Leaves were falling to the ground (叶子纷纷落下)，He dropped his cigar (他将雪茄扔掉)，Plate after plate dropped from his fingers (一个又一个碟子从他指间滑落)。drop 可表示从某处跳下，如使用降落伞从飞机上跳下。但如说某人fall，则一般表示意外摔倒。如:He stumbled and fell (他绊了一下，摔倒了)。drop 和 fall 均可作名词。drop 指想象从某处掉落的高度，如：Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop (1, 600 英尺是个相当大的落差)。fall 则指意外摔倒，如：I had been badly bruised by the fall. (我摔得青一块紫一块)。

If you describe someone as fat, you are speaking in a very direct way, and this may be considered rude.

In general you should avoid using any of these words in the presence of the person you are describing.用 fat 来形容某人肥胖过于直接，而且有可能会被认为没有礼貌。表达此意更礼貌的说法是 plump 或 chubby，其中 chubby更口语化。形容某人因块头过大或体重过重而出现健康问题时用 overweight 和 obese。obese 还是医学术语，用以形容某人极度肥胖或过重。一般说来，这些词都应该避免当面使用。
