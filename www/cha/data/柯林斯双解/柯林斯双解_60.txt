You do not use the verb fit to say that something looks attractive on a person or in a place. The verb you need is suit. It is really feminine and pretty and it certainly suits you. You use the verb fit to say that clothes are the right size for you. The size 12 gown was gorgeous and fitted perfectly... The gloves didn't fit. You cannot usually say that one colour, pattern, or object suits another. The verb you need is match. She wears a straw hat with a yellow ribbon to match her yellow cheesecloth dress... His clothes don't quite match.
    某物穿在某人身上或放在某处好看，不能用 fit 表示，而应用 suit。例如，It is really feminine and pretty and it certainly suits you(这件衣服很有女人味，又很漂亮，你穿着肯定好看)。动词 fit 则表示衣服尺码合适。例如，The size 12 gown was gorgeous and fitted perfectly(这件 12 码的礼服非常漂亮，而且大小正合适)，The gloves didn't fit(手套大小不合适)。suit 通常不能用来表示色彩、图案或物件互相匹配，应用动词 match。例如，She wears a straw hat with a yellow ribbon to match her yellow cheesecloth dress (她戴着一顶系有黄丝带的草帽，和她那件黄色薄棉纱连衣裙正好搭配), His clothes don't quite match (他的衣服不太搭)。
