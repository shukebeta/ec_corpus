Both for and to can be used to talk about somebody's purpose, but in different structures. For must be followed by a noun when expressing purpose. Occasionally I go to the pub for a drink.For is not normally used before a verb. You cannot say 'I go to the pub for to have a drink'. You can use for before an -ing form to describe the purpose of an object. …a small machine for weighing the post. With verbs, the infinitive is used without 'for'. She then went off to fetch help.
    for 和 to 都可以用于谈论某人的目的，但是所用结构不同。表示目的时，for 后面必须接名词，例如:Occasionally I go to the pub for a drink (我偶尔会到酒吧里喝一杯)。for 一般不用在动词前。不能说I go to the pub for to have a drink。可以在-ing形式前用for来描述某物的用途，例如:a small machine for weighing the post (给邮件称重的小机器)。for 不与动词不定式连用, 如: She then went off to fetch help (她接着出去找人帮忙)。
