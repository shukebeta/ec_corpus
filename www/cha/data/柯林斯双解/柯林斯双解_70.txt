Be careful not to confuse the verbs grow up and bring up. Grow up is an intransitive verb, and describes the process of becoming an adult. I grew up in rural southern England. Bring up is a transitive verb, and describes the process of looking after and socializing a child. ...we both felt the town was the perfect place to bring up a family.  Note then, that parents do not 'grow up' their children, they 'bring them up'.不要混淆grow up与bring up。grow up是不及物动词，描述长大成人的过程：I grew up in rural southern England（我在英格兰南部乡村长大）。bring up是及物动词，描述的是养育孩子并使之适应社会的过程：We both felt the town was the perfect place to bring up a family（我们俩都觉得这个小镇是养儿育女的理想之地）。注意：父母养育子女不能说 grow up，只能说bring them up。相关词组：grow apart grow away from grow into grow on grow out grow out of grow up
