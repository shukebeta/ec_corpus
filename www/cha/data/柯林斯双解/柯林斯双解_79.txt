Sick often suggests the actual physical feeling of being ill, for example nausea or vomiting. I spent the next 24 hours in bed, groaning and being sick. In American English, sick is often used where British people would say ill. Some people get hurt in accidents or get sick.
    ill 和 sick 意义非常相似, 但是用法略有不同。ill通常不用于名词前, 但可用于 fall ill, be taken ill 等动词词组中, 如He fell ill shortly before Christmas (他圣诞节前不久突然病倒了), One of the jury members was taken ill (陪审团的一名成员突然病了)。sick 常用在名词之前，如 sick children (生病的孩子)。在英国英语中, ill 比 sick 更礼貌委婉。sick 常表示生病时的身体感受, 例如恶心、呕吐等：I spent the next 24 hours in bed, groaning and being sick (接下来的 24 个小时我都躺在床上, 不停地呻吟，感到一阵阵恶心)。英国人常用 ill 的情况在美国英语中更常用 sick: Some people get hurt in accidents or get sick (一些人在事故中受伤或生病)。
