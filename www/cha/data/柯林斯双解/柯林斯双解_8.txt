You use both arrive and reach to talk about coming to a particular place. You can use arrive to emphasize being in a place rather than travelling to it. When I arrived in England I was exhausted. Reach is always followed by a noun or pronoun referring to a place, and you can use it to emphasize the effort required to get there. To reach the capital might not be easy. Arrive at and reach can also be used to say that someone eventually makes a decision or finds the answer to something. It took hours to arrive at a decision... They were unable to reach a decision.arrive和reach都可表示到达某地。arrive强调“在某地”，而非“去某地”：When I arrived in England I was exhausted（我到达英格兰的时候已经精疲力竭了）。reach后面总是接表示地点的名词或代词，强调到达某地的不易：To reach the capital might not be easy（到达首都可能不太容易）。arrive at和reach也可以用来表示终于作出决定或是找到答案：It took hours to arrive at a decision（作决定花了几个小时的时间），They were unable to reach a decision（他们没能达成一项决议）。
