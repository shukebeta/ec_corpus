Do not confuse journey, voyage, trip, and excursion. A journey is the process of travelling from one place to another by land, air, or sea. ...a journey of over 2,000 miles. If you journey to a place, you travel there. This is a literary use. The nights became colder as they journeyed north. A voyage is a very long journey from one place to another, usually by sea or through space. ...the voyage to the moon in 1972. A trip is the process of travelling from one place to another, staying there, usually for a short time, and coming back again. ...a business trip to Milan. Note that the verb trip is not used with this meaning. An excursion is a short trip made either as a tourist or in order to do a particular thing. The tourist office organizes excursions to the palace of Knossos. 
    不要混淆 journey，voyage，trip和excursion。journey指经由陆路、空路或海路，从一地到另一地的旅程，如：a journey of over 2, 000 miles （2, 000多英里的旅程）。表示旅行到某个地方用journey，这是文雅的用法：The nights became colder as they journeyed north（他们北上的过程中，夜晚变得越来越冷）。voyage通常指乘船或乘坐飞行器进行的长途旅行：the voyage to the moon in 1972（1972年的登月之旅）。trip通常指短期逗留的往返旅程：a business trip to Milan（到米兰出差）。注意，trip用作动词时含义不同。excursion指短途的观光游览或有其他目的的短途旅行：The tourist office organizes excursions to the palace of Knossos（旅游局组织去克诺索斯王宫观光游览）。
