Assassinate is used to talk about the murder of an important person, often for political reasons. If a large number of people are murdered, the words slaughter or massacre are sometimes used. Slaughter can also be used to talk about killing animals for their meat.有几个词与kill意思相近。murder指蓄意地杀害。assassinate常指为政治目的而暗杀重要人物。如果指大批人被杀，则有时用slaughter或massacre。slaughter也用于指屠宰动物取肉。
