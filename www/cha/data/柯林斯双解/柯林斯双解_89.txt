★☆☆   lay
1. VERB AND NOUN USES 动词和名词用法2. ADJECTIVE USES 形容词用法

In standard English, the form lay is also the past tense of the verb lie in some meanings. In informal English, people sometimes use the word lay instead of lie in those meanings.在标准英语中，lay亦作动词lie某些义项的过去式。而在非正式英语中，人们有时用lay来代替这些义项中的lie。Usage Note :
Do not confuse the verb lay with the verb lie. Because lay is used to talk about putting something in a particular place or position, it is related to the verb lie. If someone lays something somewhere, it lies there. The past tense and past participle of lay are both laid and it is usually a transitive verb. They laid him on the floor. However, lie is an intransitive verb with the past tense lay and the past participle lain. I lay on the floor with my legs in the air. 
    不要混淆lay和lie这两个动词。lay表示将某物放于某处或某个位置，意思上与动词lie有相关之处。如某人把某物安放（lay）在某处，此物即放（lie）在那里。lay的过去式和过去分词均为laid，它通常用作及物动词。例如，They laid him on the floor（他们把他放在地上）。lie则为不及物动词，其过去式为lay，过去分词为lain：I lay on the floor with my legs in the air（我躺在地上，双腿抬起）。
