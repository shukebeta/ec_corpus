11.   to let sleeping dogs lie→see: dog; to lie in state→see: state; to take something lying down→see: take; Usage Note :
Do not confuse the verb lie with the verb lay. Because lay is used to talk about putting something in a particular place or position, it is related to the verb lie. If someone lays something somewhere, it lies there. The past tense of lie is lay and the past participle is lain. It is an intransitive verb. I lay on the floor with my legs in the air. However, lay, whose past tense and past participle are both laid, is usually a transitive verb. They laid him on the floor. 
    不要混淆lie与lay这两个动词的用法。lay表示将某物放在某处或某个位置，意义上与动词lie有相关之处。某人将某物放（lay）在某处，那该物就放（lie）在那里。lie的过去式是lay，过去分词是lain，为不及物动词，如：I lay on the floor with my legs in the air（我躺在地上，双腿抬起）。而lay的过去式和过去分词均为laid，通常作及物动词，如：They laid him on the floor（他们把他放在地上）。相关词组：lie around lie back lie behind lie down
