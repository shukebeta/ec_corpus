Listen here, young lady. Don't you call me that!你给我听着，小姐。别那样叫我！Usage Note :
Do not confuse listen and hear. If you want to say that someone is paying attention to something they can hear, you say that they are listening to it. He turned on the radio and listened to the news. Note that listen is not followed directly by an object. You must always say that you listen to something. However, listen can also be used on its own without an object. I was laughing too much to listen. You use hear to talk about sounds that you are aware of because they reach your ears. You often use can with hear. I can hear him yelling and swearing. 
    不要混淆 listen 和 hear。listen to 表示注意听， 如：He turned on the radio and listened to the news（他打开收音机听新闻）。注意listen不能直接跟宾语，只能说listen to something。不过，listen亦可不带宾语单独使用，如：I was laughing too much to listen（我当时笑得太厉害了，根本没听）。hear 用来表示听见已经传到耳朵里的声音。它常与can连用，如：I can hear him yelling and swearing（我能听到他在大叫大骂）。相关词组：listen in
