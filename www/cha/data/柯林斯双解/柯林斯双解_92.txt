I would have to learn, little by little, to exist alone.我得慢慢学会独自生活。Usage Note :
You can use the adjective little to talk about things that are small. ...a little house. ...little children. However, little is not normally used to emphasize or draw attention to the fact that something is small. For instance, you do not usually say 'The town is little' or 'I have a very little car', but you can say The town is small' or I have a very small car'. Little is a less precise word than small, and may be used to suggest the speaker's  feelings or attitude towards the person or thing being described. For that reason, little is often used after another adjective. What a nice little house you've got here!... Shut up, you horrible little boy! Little and a little are both used as determiners in front of uncount nouns, but they do not have the same meaning. For example, if you say 'I have a little money', this is a positive statement and you are saying that you have some money. However, if you say 'I have little money', this is a negative statement and you are saying that you have almost no money.little作形容词时表示“小的”，如：a little house（小房子），little children（小孩子）。但little一般不用于强调某物之小，如通常不会说 The town is little或 I have a very little car, 但可以说The town is small（这个城镇很小）或 I have a very small car（我有一辆很小的汽车）。little不如small精确，而且可用于表示说话人对于所谈论的人或物的感情或态度。因而，little常跟在另一个形容词之后，如：What a nice little house you've got here（你这小房子真漂亮啊），Shut up, you horrible little boy（闭嘴，你这个讨厌的小家伙）。little和a little都可用作限定词修饰不可数名词，但其含义不同。例如，I have a little money（我有一点钱）是肯定陈述，表示有一些钱，而I have little money（我没什么钱）是否定陈述，表示几乎没钱。

The comparative littler and the superlative littlest are sometimes used in spoken English for meanings 1, 3, and 4, but otherwise the comparative and superlative forms of the adjective little are not used.口语中义项1、3、4有时用比较级littler和最高级littlest，但除此之外little作形容词时都不用比较级和最高级。
