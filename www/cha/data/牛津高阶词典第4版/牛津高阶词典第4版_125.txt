 NOTE ON USAGE 用法 Indefinite pronouns such as somebody, someone, everyone, no one, etc are singular and, grammatically, should be followed by othersingular pronouns (he, she, his, her, etc). *somebody﹑someone﹑ everyone﹑ no one等不定代词均为单数, 根据语法规则, 後面应该用其他单数代词（he﹑ she﹑ his﹑ her等）. Traditionally, if the sex of the person is unknown, the masculine pronouns he, him, his have been used to refer to both females and males 按照传统用法, 若性别不详则男女两性均用阳性代词he﹑ him﹑ his表示: 
• Everybody has his own view of what happened. 对於所发生的事情, 各人有各人的看法. 
• Somebody has lost his car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. 
• Did anybody hurt himself? 有人受伤了吗? Many people today consider this shows sexual bias and try to avoid it. 如今很多人认为这种用法有性别偏见之嫌, 因而尽量加以避免. The preferred way, especially in speech, is to use they, them or their with a singular neutral meaning 较为可取的方法是使用they﹑ them或their, 并赋以单数的中性含义, 尤用於口语: 
• Everyone said they would help. 大家都表示要帮忙. 
• Either John or Jane has to give up their job. 不是约翰就是简, 总有一个得放弃工作. Another way, especially in writing, is to use(s)he, he or she, him or her, his or her, though some people find this clumsy 另一种方法尤见於书面形式, 是使用(s)he﹑ he or she﹑ him or her﹑ his or her, 但有些人认为过於累赘: 
• Somebody has lost his or her car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. A third possibility is to rephrase the sentence to make the subject plural, thus avoiding the problem 第三种用法是修改句子, 使主语变为复数以避开这个问题: 
• Did any of you hurt yourselves? 有人受伤了吗? See also note on usage at he. 参见he词条的用法说明.
