 NOTE ON USAGE 用法 
■ 1 It is sometimes difficult to decide whether length (adj long), width (adj wide) or depth (adj deep) is the correct term for a particular measurement. 对於物体某一边的量度, 在length (adj long)﹑ width (adj wide)或depth (adj deep)中选用哪个才对, 有时颇难确定. The measurements of a room or of a rectangular area or object are the length (measured along the longer sides) and the width (measured along the shorter sides) 量度房间或长方形的面积或物体, 用length（长度, 沿较长的边量得）和width（宽度, 沿较短的边量得）表示: 
• The garage is 6 metres long and 3 metres wide. 汽车房长6米, 宽3米. When describing a piece of furniture that has a front and a back, both length and width can be used for the longer sides and depth is used for the measurement from front to back. 在形容一件有前後之分的家具时, length和width均可用以指较长的边, 而depth（深度）则指从前面到後面的尺寸. 
■ Length is generally used when the measurement of the front is much greater than that of the depth. 若前面的长短远远超过深度, 一般用length. *Width is used when the measurements of the front and of the depth are similar. 若前面的长短与深度相似, 则用width. (See illustration 见插图. ) 
■ 2 Compare wide and broad. 试比较wide和broad. 
■ Wide is the more general word but broad is used of parts of the body *wide适用范围较广, broad则特指身体的部位: 
• a broad nose 大鼻子 
• broad shoulders 宽阔的双肩. Otherwise it is more formal than wide and is often used, especially in literary language, to describe features of the landscape 在其他情况下, broad比wide更文雅, 尤其在文学语言中常用以描绘景色: 
• a broad river 宽阔的河 
• a broad expanse of unspoilt country 一片广袤的﹑ 自然美未受破坏的郊野.
