 NOTE ON USAGE 用法 When indicating possession, the most commonly used verb in British English is have got (in present tense forms) 在表示‘有’的意思时, 英式英语中最常用的动词是have got（用现在时态）: 
• `Have you got any pets?' `Yes, I've got three rabbits and a tortoise.' ‘你有什麽宠物吗?’‘有, 我有三只兔子和一只乌龟.’ In US English (and commonly in tenses other than the present in British English) have is used 在美式英语中, 用have表示‘有’（在英式英语, have表示‘有’时一般不用於现在时态, 但常用於其他时态）: 
• I have an apartment in downtown Manhattan. 我在曼哈顿中心区有一套住房. 
• I haven't got a car now but I'll have one next week. 我现在没有汽车, 但是下星期就能有一辆. 
■ Have when used in the present tense in British English is more formal than have got *have在英式英语中用於现在时态, 比用have got显得郑重: 
• I have no objection to your proposal. 我对你的提议没有异议. In British English have got, indicating possession, behaves like an auxiliary verb and a pp 在英式英语中, have got表示‘有’的意思时, 其用法如同一个助动词加一个过去分词:

• `Do you have a computer?' `Yes I do.' ‘你有计算机吗?’‘我有.’ This construction is common in British English in tenses other than the present 这种结构在英式英语中多用於除现在式以外的其他时态: 
• I didn't have any money so I couldn't get a newspaper. 我当时没有钱, 所以没能买报纸. It is also increasingly found in the present tense. 这种用法现亦逐渐多见於现在时态.
