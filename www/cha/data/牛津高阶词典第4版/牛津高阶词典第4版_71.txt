 NOTE ON USAGE 用法 A few adjectives have misleading `negative' affixes such as in- or -less. 有几个形容词带有貌似‘否定’的词缀, 如in-或-less. 

 Invaluable means `extremely valuable'. *invaluable意思是‘极有价值的’. It is not the opposite of valuable, which is valueless (or worthless). 这个词并不是valuable的反义词, valuable的反义词是valueless（或worthless）. 

 Priceless means `too valuable to be priced', ie `having a very high price'.*priceless意思是‘贵重得无法定出价格的’, 即‘价格非常高的’. 

 Innumerable and numberless mean `too many to be counted' or `very numerous'. *innumerable和numberless 意思是‘多得数不清的’或‘极多的’. 

 Flammable and inflammable have the same meaning (opposite: non-flammable). *flammable和inflammable意思一样, 是‘易燃的’（反义词是: non-flammable‘不易燃的’）.
